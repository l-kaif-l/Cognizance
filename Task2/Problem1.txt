Basically for a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of 
its digits of the number should be divisible by 3

DECLARE remainder = 0
DECLARE number = 0
DECLARE sum = 0

print 'Enter the number'
INPUT number

WHILE number > 0
	remainder = number % 10		//Using modulus operator with 10 we could
					//extract each and every digit of a number

	sum = sum + remainder		//Extracting digits from the entered number 
					//and calculating the sum of them

	number = number /10		//The number remains with the removed digit
					//when divided by 10
END LOOP

IF sum % 3 == 0 THEN
 	print 'True'
ELSE
	print 'False'
END ELSE
END IF
